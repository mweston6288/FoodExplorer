**USER STORY**

AS A person that's concerned with my own health, fitness, and longevity...
I WANT to know whether what I'm eating each day is adequate and nutritious enough...
SO THAT I can confirm or change my eating habits in support of a healthy, intentional lifestyle...

**DESCRIPTION**

The idea is to have an app that allows a person to input the foods they have eaten each day along with other personal criteria and submit.  Then, the app will use this input to query APIs and collect nutritional information about the foods eaten as well as daily nutritional requirements based on the person's personal details. The app will compare the sets nutritional information and then display all the information plus color-coded results in an easy-to-read chart. 

EXTRAS: 
- also provide food recommendations for fulfilling nutritional requirements
- switch to using a different API if default API fails to provide result
- compile and store a digest of current day's input (key metrics as percent with top three areas for improvement) and display as history
- display history as a graph??
